This is my code for the article "A Complete Neural-Network-Based Representation of High-Dimension Convolutional Neural Networks" showing the equivalence between 
a sCNN (standard Convolution neural network) and a lCNN (linearized CNN). The input is a 3D (RGB) tensor (a puppy) with 4 kernels/filters. This example also validates theorems
in the paper.
